description: Notes and slides about deep learning algorithms
---

---
Some notes and surveys that I wrote to help me understand the machine learning topics and papers better. I also attached few codes for demonstration purpose.
* Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (long survey)
* Semi-supervised Toy Examples and Visualizations
* Information Theory
  * KL Divergence: Forward vs. KL-Backward
  *  KL Divergence vs. Mutual Information
