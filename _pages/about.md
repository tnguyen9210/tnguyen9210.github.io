Hi! I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the UA. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kwang-Sung Jun](https://kwangsungjun.github.io/), working on bandits algorithms and theoretical machine learning. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the UO, working with Prof. [Prof. Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/) in cross-lingual and multi-lingual NLP. 
<!-- . I received my Bachelor's degree in Finance from [CUNY Baruch College](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu). -->

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in developing and analyzing adaptive decion-making algorithms including bandit algorithms, Monte Carlo tree search methods, and reinforcement learning.

<!-- My broad research interests lie in learning machine learning algorithms and innovating solutions for vision and languages problems. I am particularly interested in unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. My research has been focusing on applying unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms for cross-lingual and multi-lingual NLP problems. -->

<!-- I have strong desire to do research, learning and creating new potentially useful theories and applications. I am currently looking for a PhD position that focuses machine learning projects. -->
