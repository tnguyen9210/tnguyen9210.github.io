Hi! I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the UA. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Kwang-Sung Jun](https://kwangsungjun.github.io/), working on decision-making algorithms. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the UO, working with Prof. [Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/) in domain adaptation and multi-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
<!-- . I received my Bachelor's degree in Finance from [CUNY Baruch College](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu). -->

My research interests lie in adaptive decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and Reinforcement Learning. In particular, my work focuses on developing algorithms that provably adapt to the difficulty and complexity of particular problem instances, and perform optimally in worst-case and/or adversarial scenarios.

<!-- I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in developing and analyzing adaptive decision-making algorithms including bandit algorithms, Monte Carlo tree search methods, and reinforcement learning. -->

<!-- My broad research interests lie in learning machine learning algorithms and innovating solutions for vision and languages problems. I am particularly interested in unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. My research has been focusing on applying unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms for cross-lingual and multi-lingual NLP problems. -->

<!-- I have strong desire to do research, learning and creating new potentially useful theories and applications. I am currently looking for a PhD position that focuses machine learning projects. -->
